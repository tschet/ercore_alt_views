# ERCore Alternate Views

This is a Drupal 7 module. It is an add-on to the current 
[ERCore module](https://github.com/EPSCoR/ERCore-3.1). This dependency can be 
a problem if you're using Drush. The existing ERCore module uses the incorrect 
namespace of ER, which conflicts with an existing Drupal module (Entity 
Relationships). Development to fix this, and other Drupal standards issues, is 
planned.

## INSTALLATION ##
Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/895232 for further information. 

This module is entirely optional with ERCore (ER). It will not work with the 
newer version of ERCore (ercore). This module should be immediately uninstalled 
if not required. It should not be left deactivated, but not installed.
 
## CONFIGURATION ##
There are no specific configuration settings for the ERCore Alt Views module.
